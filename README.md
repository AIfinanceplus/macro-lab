# Agent Engineering from Scratch

A step-by-step repository for building an Agent Runtime and turning it into a grounded research Agent.

## Rigorous Macro Research Agent Lab — nine principles in one system

`serve_macro_lab.py` is a standalone visual reference application that combines
an eight-year, ten-series deterministic CPI factor engine, OpenBB macro data,
OpenBB/official news, OpenAI Responses API synthesis, seven role-bounded agents, evidence
provenance, prompt-injection quarantine, one-use capabilities, deterministic
verification, persist-before-publish NDJSON, checkpoints, and resume. Every one
of the nine rigorous Agent principles has an executable conformance check in the
UI. The CPI dashboard separates facts, statistical associations, and scenarios;
it never labels correlations as causal contributions. Fixture mode requires no credentials; Live mode never silently
substitutes fixture data when a provider fails.

Institutional Research v2 turns the model response into a depth contract rather
than a free-form summary. A publishable CPI draft must contain a central thesis,
at least eight cited claims, five factor mechanisms, historical context, a
four-quarter conditional path, three scenarios, three counterarguments, a
five-item monitoring table, methodology, data-quality disclosures, and source
notes. The printable report renders these as 12 numbered exhibits. Missing depth
is a deterministic verification failure and produces `ABSTAIN`, not a thin report.

```bash
python3 serve_macro_lab.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8011
```

See [MACRO_AGENT_LAB_ZH.md](MACRO_AGENT_LAB_ZH.md) for the architecture, Live
OpenBB setup, safety boundaries, and acceptance commands.

## Phase 1 — Runtime from scratch

V0 → V11 cover the minimal loop, Tool Registry, validation, retry, Policy, ExecutionContext, StateStore, checkpointing, Planner/DAG Scheduler, Evidence/Citation, Tracing, and Evals.

## Phase 2 — Research Agent

- R1 — Real BLS source adapter
- R2 — API-only multi-source macro research
- R3 — Research decomposition + safe query generation
- R4 — Source API health + source contract testing
- R5 — Evidence quality / freshness / contradiction
- R6 — Investment & policy synthesis + domain evals
- R7 — Forecast contracts + scenario tracking + settlement
- R8 — Decision lenses + current-run evals
- R9 — Observed market-pricing context
- R10 — Numerical target + scenario EV + instrument risk
- R11 — Constraint-based position sizing
- R12 — Strategy opportunities + live public event markets + HITL Strategy Agent

## Current stage: Rate Strategy V1 — one complete 2s10s paper simulation

The default learning path is intentionally small. It needs no event search, no
cross-market identity matching, no human settlement checklist, and no broker
credentials:

```text
D1 public FRED DGS2 + DGS10 history
      ↓ common-date alignment
S1 60-observation 2s10s spread z-score
      ↓ explicit steepener / flattener rule
E1 latest historically completed 20-observation paper trade
      ↓ DV01 approximation, explicit cost, contract eval, full Tool trace
```

`RateStrategyAgent` uses a fixed two-Tool DAG. The shared Tool Registry validates
the public-data and simulation calls before execution. V1 deliberately uses no
LLM planner: the goal is to make Planner → Runtime → Tool → Observation → Eval
visible in one click. The current Model Authority lesson adds a deterministic
scripted model adapter so malformed and unsafe proposals are repeatable; it is
explicitly not a remote LLM. The full Workbench shell is retained, including the Agent
flow and Trace / Logic / Evidence / State / Checkpoint / Architecture views; only
the Strategy workspace is narrowed to the rate strategy. The output is a teaching
approximation, not an executable bond-price model or investment recommendation.

FRED CSV calls use `native_http.http_get_text`, which keeps certificate verification
enabled while routing Python TLS through the operating system trust store via
`truststore`. Do not disable certificate verification to work around local CA errors.
The D1 public-data Tool declares two retries. The Runtime applies short exponential
backoff only to connection/time-out failures and records the failed attempt and
retry in Trace. If FRED remains unavailable after three total attempts, the HTTP
API returns `503 DATA_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` together with the partial Agent trace.

## Advanced experiment retained: R12 Step 9 event-market portfolio

R12 keeps the earlier Runtime, Evidence, forecasting, EV, risk, and sizing layers,
then adds a five-strategy opportunity registry. The currently deepest live path is
same-event Kalshi/Polymarket relative value:

```text
Exact market identifiers
      ↓
R12 Planner DAG
      ↓
K1 / P1 public market-contract Tools through the shared Agent Runtime
      ↓
R1 fingerprint-bound deterministic settlement-rules analysis
      ↓
H1 durable WAITING_HUMAN_IDENTITY_APPROVAL checkpoint
      ↓ explicit six-check human attestation only
I1 settlement identity Tool
      ↓
V1 top-of-book reciprocal complement scan
      ↓
E1 depth-aware paper execution quote
      ↓ explicit user command; quote is never treated as a fill
Paper intent with zero fills
      ↓ idempotent simulated fill commands
Append-only hash-chained event ledger
      ↓ deterministic replay
Partial-leg risk / matched quantity / MTM P&L
      ↓ replay every trade ledger
Paper portfolio aggregation
      ↓ atomic preflight before every new intent / fill
Unsettled trade / acquisition cost / leg risk / provider / identity limits
      ↓ explicit YES or NO settlement
Realized paper P&L
```

The Strategy Agent persists an append-only checkpoint view after every boundary.
Resume skips durably completed tasks. No parser or model can check H1 boxes, and no
R12 component places orders. Step 7 deliberately separates the read/compute Agent
DAG from state-changing commands: E1 remains a quote, while every simulated fill,
mark, cancel/expire, and settlement requires an idempotency key and is recorded as
an fsync'd JSONL event under `.r12_paper_ledger/`.

Step 8 reorganizes the operator surface without changing those backend contracts:

```text
Agent Run          default linear acceptance path
Manual Lab         structural scan + one-tool-at-a-time diagnostics
Strategy Roadmap   five strategy families + current implementation boundary
```

The Agent Run workspace now follows user task order rather than implementation
history: discover pair → lock exact IDs → configure explicit costs → start/resume
Agent → review H1 beside the six checkboxes → inspect I1/V1/E1 → paper ledger.

Step 9 keeps each ledger immutable and adds a separate portfolio read model. It
replays every `.r12_paper_ledger/*.jsonl` stream, aggregates unsettled cost,
unmatched leg quantity, provider notional, same-settlement-identity concentration,
MTM completeness, and realized P&L. New intents and fills are serialized through
an atomic preflight; a rejected command appends no event. The current teaching
limits are explicit code configuration, not calibrated investment advice.
Exposure is conservatively added across trades; Step 9 gives no correlation,
diversification, or cross-trade netting credit.

Current five-strategy roadmap:

```text
1. Structural / logic arbitrage        deterministic scanner active
2. Same-event cross-market RV          live public data + HITL agent active
3. FOMC probability RV                 planned
4. CPI / macro-data RV                 research engine ready, calibration pending
5. Options vs event-market RV          planned
```

## R7 forecasting foundation retained

```text

      ↓

      ↓
PENDING / INVALIDATED / RESOLVED HIT / RESOLVED MISS
      ↓
Scenario update + revision decision
```

The key R7 distinction is:

```text
Opinion != Forecast

A Forecast must be falsifiable and settleable.
```

Every OPEN forecast has:

```text
forecast_id
target Evidence ID
target metric
baseline value + baseline as-of
expected direction
horizon + due date
tolerance
Evidence lineage
invalidation rule
settlement rule
```

If the Evidence is contradictory or lacks a comparable directional baseline, R7 emits `ABSTAINED` rather than forcing a prediction.

## Forecast semantics

R7 currently uses a deterministic teaching baseline:

```text
directional_persistence_baseline
```

It asks whether the next meaningful observation, by the forecast horizon, continues the currently grounded direction. This is intentionally simple so the contract, settlement, and evaluation machinery can be learned before introducing statistical/ML forecasting models.

Provider-aware teaching horizons:

```text
BLS   45 days
FRED   7 days
EIA   14 days
```

These are workbench heuristics, not provider SLAs or calibrated optimal horizons.

Forecast support scores inherit upstream Evidence quality/confidence and remain:

```text
heuristic_support_score_not_probability
```

After forecasts resolve, R7 may compute historical directional hit rate. That statistic is explicitly labeled:

```text
historical_direction_hit_rate_not_probability
```

A historical hit rate is not the probability that the next forecast is correct.

## Scenario tracker

R7 tracks explicit scenario states:

```text
UPSIDE_INFLATION
DOWNSIDE_INFLATION
MIXED
RECONCILE
STABLE
UNRESOLVED
```

Examples:

```text
UPSIDE_INFLATION
= at least two tracked signals rising and none falling

DOWNSIDE_INFLATION
= at least two tracked signals falling and none rising

MIXED
= at least one rising and at least one falling

RECONCILE
= same-claim contradiction exists in S1
```

Scenario history is stored with the forecast pack. A scenario change, a forecast miss, an early invalidation trigger, or a new contradiction marks the pack as requiring research revision.

## Durable forecast tracking

Forecast packs are stored locally under:

```text
.forecasts/
```

The directory is gitignored. The workbench reloads saved forecast pack IDs after restart.

A new R7 research run creates/saves a pack. `检查 Forecast` reloads the selected historical pack, refreshes real source Evidence through the normal Query → Runtime → Evidence path, rebuilds a fresh S1, and evaluates the old forecast against that new grounded state.

A forecast is not resolved merely because its calendar due date has passed. R7 also requires a newer source observation than the baseline observation. Otherwise it reports:

```text
AWAITING_NEW_OBSERVATION
```

Before the due date, a reversal can trigger:

```text
PENDING_NOT_DUE
invalidation_triggered = true
```

but final settlement still waits for the contract's due date.

## R6 domain layer preserved

```text
S1 = what the Evidence supports
D1 = how that grounded conclusion is framed for a decision domain
F1 = what falsifiable future statements are now being tracked
```

D1 cannot fetch new data, add Evidence IDs, or increase S1 confidence. F1 cannot fetch data, invent Evidence IDs, increase confidence, or fabricate forecast probabilities.

Investment and Policy still use the same source Evidence for the same research question; only the D1 framing changes. F1 forecast targets are derived from S1 signals, so changing the domain lens does not silently change the underlying data targets.

## Evidence quality inherited from R5

Every source Evidence record is assessed on:

```text
Authority
Freshness
Completeness
Relevance
```

Cross-source relations distinguish:

```text
AGREEMENT
MIXED_SIGNAL
CONTRADICTION
```

`MIXED_SIGNAL` is uncertainty across different indicators. `CONTRADICTION` requires opposing conclusions on the same comparable claim.

## Active public sources

```text
BLS  https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data
FRED https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations
EIA  https://api.eia.gov/v2/petroleum/pri/gnd/data/
```

Runtime environment variables:

```text
BLS_API_KEY   optional registered BLS quota
FRED_API_KEY  required when FRED is selected
EIA_API_KEY   required when EIA is selected
```

Credentials never enter Planner arguments, Evidence, citations, Trace, health reports, forecast packs, or UI diagnostics.

## Source health

```bash
python3 source_smoke.py
```

or:

```bash
python3 source_smoke.py BLS
python3 source_smoke.py FRED
python3 source_smoke.py EIA
```

Source Health keeps operational readiness, quota/rate-limit status, and observation freshness separate.

## R7 Evals

The R7 suite has four layers:

```text
1. r7-blueprint-query-contract
2. r7-research-lineage-contract
3. r7-investment-domain-contract
   OR r7-policy-domain-contract
4. r7-forecast-tracking-contract
```

Checks include:

- safe query compilation and provider allow-listing;
- dynamic `Q1..Qn → S1 → D1 → F1` DAG completion;
- one Evidence record per source query;
- final citations exactly grounded in collected Evidence;
- S1 quality coverage and non-probabilistic confidence semantics;
- D1 cannot add Evidence or raise confidence;
- F1 inherits Evidence IDs and confidence;
- every OPEN forecast has baseline, target metric, direction, due date, horizon, lineage, and invalidation rule;
- contradictions force forecast abstention for affected Evidence;
- scenario states have explicit triggers;
- F1 performs no new source fetch and invents no new Evidence;
- neither forecast support scores nor historical hit rates are represented as probabilities.

CI remains network-independent by injecting API-shaped source responses while exercising the same production parser, Runtime, Evidence, synthesis, forecast, and settlement contracts.

## Run the Agent Graph & Live Stream console

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 serve_rates.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The default page has only two work areas: **Agent Graph** and **Agent Live Stream**.

1. Click **Run Agent**. The default parameters remain 60 observations, z=1,
   20-observation holding period, $100/bp DV01 and 1bp round-trip cost. The
   default scenario pauses the live stream at a real H1 human-approval boundary.
   Use the visible Approve/Deny buttons to resolve that same running task.
2. Follow Goal → RG1 → CG1 → TG1 → CT1 → MR1 → M1 → P1 → Runtime → L1 Lease/Fencing → H1 Human Approval → AZ1 Capability Gate → C1 → D1 → V1 →
   Q1 → **A2 / A10** → J1 → S1 → O1 Outbox → LG1 Paper Ledger → E1.
   D1 still fetches one bulk dataset. A2 and A10 independently prepare the 2Y
   and 10Y series; J1 checks that both came from the same run and source batch.
   S1 consumes the joined output. Runtime remains active throughout. No LLM is used.
3. The stream includes the approval request, human decision and scoped elevation,
   followed by capability minting, claim verification, consumption or
   denial, plus retrieval query construction, citation checks, final Context
   Pack, route selection, token reservation/settlement, the model prompt, raw
   output, parse/validation decision, every emitted node event, registry lookup,
   Tool call (full arguments), Tool result (full output), retry and Eval result.
   Expand a row to inspect JSON; no observations are truncated.
4. Click a Graph node to filter events; click it again or “显示全部” to reset.
   “跟随最新” controls scrolling without discarding earlier events.
5. D1 discloses the actual provider, source date and offline-snapshot status.
   Failures retain received events and mark downstream nodes as unexecuted.
6. Export JSON to retain the completed run or a partial failure trace.

The `POST /api/rates/stream` transport uses `rate-ndjson-v1` for every frame,
one unique run ID per request and consecutive event sequence numbers. A closed
connection without a terminal result/error is not considered success. Source
attempt details are reported when D1 returns, not during individual network reads.
The UI now requests `execution_mode="parallel"`; omitted mode retains the previous
serial API for compatibility. Every stream envelope is first fsync'd to the
append-only `RateEventLog` and then delivered. `POST /api/rates/replay` reads that
log, marks the start frame as `replayed`, and returns the same ordered messages;
the browser's “重放最近 Run” button feeds them through the same reducer, so no
Tool is called a second time. `RATE_EVENT_DIR` can point at a durable directory;
the default is a process-independent temporary teaching directory.

### Current lesson: Paper Ledger Reconciliation

This lesson makes the paper ledger the durable source of truth for the simulated
trade. S1 produces a candidate result, then LG1 appends three paper-only events:
`paper_intent_created → paper_fill_recorded → paper_trade_closed`. The hash-chained
JSONL is fsync'd before its result is streamed. LG1 replays those events into a
fresh projection and compares the trade ID, direction, spread, gross P&L, cost
and net P&L with S1. A mismatch stops before E1.

| Boundary | What is persisted | What the learner can verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paper write | Intent, fill and close events with idempotency keys | The ledger, not in-memory state, is the source of truth |
| Replay | Ordered events plus previous/event hashes | A fresh projection can rebuild the same trade |
| Reconciliation | Expected vs Replayed fields | `RECONCILED` continues to E1; `MISMATCH` blocks it |

Choose `故障演示 · 篡改账本后阻断 E1` to see the explicit mismatch path. No
broker, account or real order API exists in this lesson.

### Previous lesson: Replayable Event Stream

This lesson separates **live delivery** from **durable history**. A stream is not
just a socket: `start → event* → result/error` is an ordered artifact that can be
recovered after a browser disconnect or Runtime restart. The UI makes the
distinction explicit: a fresh run says “事件流已完成”, while a replay says
“历史事件已重放 · 未重新调用 Tool”.

| Boundary | What is persisted | What the learner can verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before delivery | Every NDJSON envelope, including full Tool arguments/results | A network failure cannot erase the audit trail |
| Replay cursor | Events after `after_sequence`, plus start and terminal frame | Recovery resumes in order without re-executing D1/S1/O1 |
| UI reducer | The same `applyMessage` path for live and replay | Graph states, attempts and raw history converge |

Engineering contract:

- Event sequence numbers are consecutive and bound to one `run_id`; gaps and
  duplicate starts are rejected by the log.
- A terminal result/error is persisted before the HTTP request completes.
- Replay is read-only. The frontend has observation/control permissions, not Tool
  execution permissions; replay never invokes an Agent.
- The log is a teaching JSONL store. Production would use a transactional event
  store with retention, compaction and authenticated cursors.

Source files: `rate_event_log.py`, `serve_rates.py`, `web/rate_console.js`.

#### Stream visualization contract

The console keeps one compact teaching surface instead of hiding new features in
raw JSON. The **What Changed** strip shows `Persist → Deliver → Observe → Replay`,
the metrics line counts persisted frames, Tool attempts, known side effects and
the terminal outcome, and each event row adds a phase/state/effect line. The
result banner distinguishes a live recorded run from a read-only historical
replay. Graph filtering only narrows the rows; the original event history stays
in memory and remains exportable.

### Previous lesson: Outbox, at-least-once delivery and idempotent side effects

O1 separates “记录要做什么” from “把副作用送到目标”。Runtime first atomically
writes a pending command to the durable Outbox. The Dispatcher may deliver it more
than once, so the target Sink must deduplicate by the same `idempotency_key`.
The demo deliberately crashes after the Sink applies but before the ACK is saved;
the retry is therefore `DEDUPLICATED` and the effect count remains one. A stale
fencing token is checked before the Sink, so it produces no side effect.

| Scenario | Failure boundary | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 确认丢失 · 同一 key 重试并去重 | Sink succeeded, ACK was lost, then the same command is retried | `ENQUEUE → DISPATCH → ACK LOST → DISPATCH → DEDUPLICATED → ACK` |
| 旧 Runtime · 副作用前被 fencing 拦截 | Runtime A presents token 1 after Runtime B owns token 2 | `FENCED → SIDE EFFECT BLOCKED → EFFECT APPLIED` |

Engineering contract:

- Delivery is at-least-once; this lesson does not claim distributed exactly-once.
- The idempotency key binds one command to one logical effect. Reusing it is safe;
  changing the command under the same key is rejected.
- Fencing happens before the side-effect boundary, while the Sink itself is
  idempotent in case a crash occurs after application but before acknowledgement.
- The repository implementation is a durable JSON teaching store. Production would
  use a transactional database outbox, replayable ordered stream and an idempotent
  target API.

Source files: `rate_outbox.py`, `rate_parallel.py`.

### Previous lesson: Multi-instance coordination with Lease and Fencing Token

L1 models the ownership boundary around one Agent Run. A Runtime must acquire
the `rate-run` lease, keep it alive before its TTL expires, and present the
current fencing token immediately before a Tool can execute. If Runtime A
stalls, Runtime B can take over with a larger token; A is fenced even if its
process is still alive.

| Scenario | Coordination condition | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime A 失联 · Runtime B 接管 (default) | A lease expires, B acquires token 2, A presents stale token 1 | `LEASE ACQUIRED → LEASE EXPIRED → TAKEOVER → FENCED → SIDE EFFECT BLOCKED → FENCE PASS` |
| Runtime A 续租 · 保持执行权 | The same owner renews before TTL expiry | `ACQUIRE → RENEW → RENEWED → FENCE PASS → TOOL CALL` |

Engineering contract:

- A lease is a time-bounded ownership hint, not a permanent lock.
- Every takeover increments a fencing token; a stale owner cannot write merely
  because its thread or process has not stopped.
- Runtime checks ownership immediately before each Tool boundary. A rejected
  stale check produces no Tool call and no side effect.
- The coordinator is intentionally in-memory for this lesson. Production would
  need an external transactional store, clock/TTL discipline, fencing at the
  actual write target, and authenticated instance identity.

Source file: `rate_leases.py`.

### Previous lesson: Durable approval and restart recovery

H1 now writes the pending approval request and its parameter fingerprint to an
fsync'd JSON checkpoint before waiting. After approval, the teaching stream
discards the old in-memory registry, creates a fresh registry instance, restores
the record from disk and revalidates every binding before AZ1 can mint a ticket.

| Scenario | Recovery condition | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 批准后重启 · 从磁盘恢复并继续 (default) | Stored decision, run, Tool, scope and parameter fingerprint all match | `CHECKPOINT SAVED → RUNTIME RESTART → APPROVAL RESTORED → RESUME SAFE → MINT → TOOL CALL` |
| 参数已变化 · 旧批准失效 | Resumed holding period produces a different SHA-256 parameter fingerprint | `STALE APPROVAL`; no Capability or Tool call; a new approval is required |
| Deny from either scenario | Durable record stores the denial | Run ends before restart/elevation and no authority is issued |

Engineering contract:

- The approval record is atomically replaced and both file and directory are
  fsync'd before the Runtime claims `CHECKPOINT SAVED`.
- A fresh Registry instance reads the record from disk; tests also launch an
  independent Python process to verify the checkpoint is not memory-only.
- Recovery rechecks decision, `run_id`, Tool, scope and parameter fingerprint.
  Approval is rejected if any command-defining input changed.
- The one-click UI keeps the HTTP stream open and visualizes a fresh Runtime
  registry boundary. It does not claim that the teaching web-server process
  itself exited; cross-process durability is verified separately.
- Production still needs authenticated approver identity, database transactions,
  distributed leases and multi-instance coordination.

### Previous lesson: Human approval and permission elevation

**H1** is a real pause, not a prerecorded event. The streaming request remains
open while the browser displays Approve and Deny buttons. A second HTTP request
resolves the pending decision, after which the same run either continues or
terminates without issuing a capability.

| Human decision | Runtime behavior | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approve once | Authorize only the current `simulate_one_curve_trade` request, `paper:simulate` scope and parameter fingerprint | `WAITING HUMAN → APPROVED → ELEVATE ONCE → MINT → AUTH CHECK → TOOL CALL` |
| Deny | Do not mint any elevated capability | H1 fails with `HUMAN_APPROVAL_DENIED`; no Tool function starts |
| No response for 90 seconds | Expire the approval request | H1 fails with `HUMAN_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`; downstream remains blocked |

Engineering contract:

- The Agent and model cannot approve their own privilege escalation.
- Approval binds the current run, target Tool, scope and SHA-256 parameter
  fingerprint; it is not reusable consent for later runs.
- Approval is not execution. It permits the Runtime to mint a short-lived,
  single-use Capability, which AZ1 must still verify.
- Denial and timeout happen before capability issuance and before every Tool
  call, making zero side effects directly auditable.
- Approval state is process-local in this teaching implementation. A production
  system would persist it transactionally and authenticate the human identity.

Source file: `rate_approval.py`.

### Previous lesson: Least privilege and capability tickets

**AZ1** separates knowing a Tool from being authorized to call it. For the
current teaching scenarios the Runtime mints signed, short-lived tickets bound
to one run, task, Tool, scope and logical use. The function is entered only
after the ticket passes every check.

| Scenario | Capability policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 票据 Tool 不匹配 · 调用前 DENIED (default) | D1 requests `fetch_public_rate_history`, but its signed ticket names `simulate_one_curve_trade` and `paper:simulate` | AZ1 reports `tool_not_authorized` and `scope_not_authorized`; no `TOOL CALL` exists |
| 最小权限票据 · 单次完整运行 | Every planned task receives exactly its required Tool and scope for one logical use | `MINT → AUTH CHECK → VERIFIED → CONSUMED` precedes each of five Tool calls |
| 票据已过期 · 调用前 DENIED | D1 receives an otherwise valid ticket whose expiry is in the past | AZ1 reports `capability_expired`; D1 function and all downstream work remain unexecuted |

Engineering contract:

- Default authorization is deny. A Tool Registry entry is discoverability, not
  permission.
- Tickets are HMAC-SHA256 signed and bind `run_id`, `task_id`, `tool_name`,
  `scope`, `expires_at` and `max_uses`.
- The signing secret never appears in a ticket, event, model prompt or Tool
  argument. The UI shows only an abbreviated signature.
- A ticket cannot be reused across runs, tasks or Tools, widened to another
  scope, modified without invalidating its signature, used after expiry or
  consumed twice.
- One ticket authorizes one logical Tool call. Runtime retries remain inside
  that already-authorized call and do not mint broader permission.
- Denial occurs before `tool_execution_started`, making the zero-side-effect
  boundary visible and testable.

Source file: `rate_capabilities.py`.

### Previous lesson: Prompt Injection defense and taint isolation

**TG1** is a trust boundary between verified provenance and the context builder.
A source may pass CG1 and still contain text that tries to become an instruction.
Every retrieved chunk therefore enters TG1 as `UNTRUSTED`; it can only leave as
`PROMOTE_AS_DATA` or `QUARANTINE`.

| Scenario | Security policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 恶意内容混入 · 隔离后继续 (default) | Clean official DGS2/DGS10 chunks and a source-valid injected chunk are retrieved together | TG1 shows the raw attack, quarantines the whole chunk, preserves clean coverage, and the Agent safely continues |
| 唯一证据含攻击 · 调用前 ABSTAIN | The only source-valid evidence also requests instruction override, shell execution and secret disclosure | Quarantine removes all safe coverage; TG1 raises `PROMPT_INJECTION_BLOCKED` before CT1, model, Runtime or Tools |
| 干净资料 · 正常传播 | Both official chunks contain data only | TG1 marks each `PROMOTE_AS_DATA`; the Context Pack and normal paper simulation proceed |

Engineering contract:

- Provenance trust is not instruction authority. Retrieved text is always data.
- Detection and propagation are deterministic and visible in the event stream;
  this lesson does not claim an LLM security judge.
- A suspicious chunk is quarantined whole. Partial string deletion could leave
  an obfuscated instruction with misleading meaning.
- Quarantined text stays in the audit trace but is absent from model prompts and
  every Tool argument.
- Required DGS2/DGS10 coverage is checked again after quarantine. Missing safe
  coverage produces fail-closed `ABSTAIN`.
- Runtime Tool allowlists and schema validation remain a separate defense even
  after content screening.

Source file: `rate_prompt_security.py`.

### Previous lesson: RAG retrieval and citation provenance

**RG1** retrieves candidate evidence; **CG1** decides whether retrieved evidence
is allowed to become model context. This lesson deliberately separates
relevance from trust. A text chunk can be highly related to the user goal and
still be unusable if it is stale, missing provenance or fails to cover both
required rate series.

The retriever is deterministic lexical overlap only. There are no embeddings,
vector databases, network calls or hidden LLM judges in this lesson, so the
ranking is easy to audit in tests and in the live stream.

| Scenario | Retrieval policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 高相关旧资料 · Citation Gate 拒绝 (default) | Top-K includes official DGS2, official DGS10 and one highly relevant but superseded note claiming direct tradeability | RG1 selects the stale chunk; CG1 marks it `rejected`; CT1 and M1 receive only verified citation IDs |
| Top-K · 只召回双期限官方资料 | Query asks for 2s10s evidence and Top-K is limited to two official sources | Both required series pass provenance checks; the context pack carries two stable citations |
| 证据缺一腿 · 调用前 ABSTAIN | DGS2 is official but DGS10 lacks attribution/provenance | CG1 raises `RAG_EVIDENCE_INSUFFICIENT`; CT1, model routing, Runtime and Tools never start |

Engineering contract:

- Retrieval recall is not evidence approval. RG1 may surface bad or stale text;
  CG1 is the trust boundary.
- Every chunk has a stable content hash and citation ID, plus source URL,
  source title, as-of date, covered series and status.
- The Citation Gate currently accepts only the official FRED/Federal Reserve
  domains used by this teaching strategy.
- A chunk marked `superseded` is rejected even when its lexical score is high.
- Both required legs, DGS2 and DGS10, must be covered by accepted citations.
  Missing coverage yields `ABSTAIN` before any model or Tool call.
- Rejected chunks remain visible in the audit stream but never enter
  `model_request_started.prompt`.
- CT1 still owns token-budget selection after CG1; RAG determines what is
  trustworthy enough to be considered as context, not how many tokens fit.

Source file: `rate_rag.py`. The fixtures are intentionally small and disclosed;
this is an auditable RAG control lesson, not a production retrieval stack.

### Previous lesson: Context Engineering and context budget

**CT1** makes model input explicit. The Agent may own policies, current
instructions, verified observations and a long conversation history, but only
the selected candidate context enters the model-input envelope as a final Context Pack. Selection resolves authoritative
conflicts first, then uses relevance and a finite context budget. Teaching token
counts are deterministic and labelled `scripted_teaching_tokens`; they are not
real tokenizer output or billing units.

| Scenario | Context policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 长历史超预算 · 压缩后装入 (default) | Mandatory policy/goal/Tool contract use 110 of 150 tokens; relevant 160-token history cannot fit | The declared lossy summary uses 40 tokens; old event notes and UI preference are dropped; PACK is exactly 150/150 |
| 相关信息 · 保留，无关信息 · 丢弃 | Budget 180; current rate evidence is relevant while old event-market and UI notes are not plan input | Four items are kept; low-relevance candidates are scored and explicitly dropped |
| 新旧指令冲突 · 以当前目标为准 | Stale event-market goal conflicts with the current 2s10s instruction | Authority and freshness select `current_goal`; the stale goal is excluded before token allocation and never reaches the prompt |

Engineering contract:

- Context is not “all available memory.” Every candidate has attribution,
  relevance, authority, freshness and a disclosed size before selection.
- Mandatory system policy, current goal and Runtime Tool contract cannot be
  silently removed to make the budget fit. If mandatory context alone is too
  large, CT1 fails closed.
- Conflicts are resolved before token packing. A stale instruction cannot win
  merely because its wording is highly relevant to the topic.
- Compression is explicit and lossy: the stream preserves original and summary
  for audit, while the model prompt contains only the summary.
- Dropped text appears in the audit decision but not in `model_request_started.prompt`.
  The PACK event equals the context attached to the model request.
- Context budget and model-call token budget are different controls. CT1 limits
  what enters the prompt; MR1 still reserves and settles the complete call.
- The routed model remains a deterministic non-LLM teaching adapter. Its output
  still passes P1 authority validation before Runtime or Tools can start.

Source file: `rate_context_engineering.py`. This is model-input context, not the
trusted `ExecutionContext` identity object and not a durable recovery checkpoint.

### Previous lesson: model routing, token budget and bounded fallback

**MR1** selects from a declared Model Registry before M1 can receive a prompt.
Every call reserves its worst-case teaching token allowance first. After the
call, MR1 charges the disclosed usage and releases the unused reservation. The
demo values are labelled `scripted_teaching_usage`; they are deterministic
teaching units, not output from a real tokenizer or billing API.

| Scenario | Routing policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 主模型超时 · 有界 Fallback (default) | Economy endpoint fails after accepting the prompt; one capable fallback is declared | Reserve 600 → charge 160 → FALLBACK 1/1 → reserve 1200 → charge 480 → route completes |
| 经济模型成功 · 不升级 | Lowest sufficient tier returns a valid proposal | One model call, 440 tokens charged, zero fallback; larger model is never called |
| 预算不足 · 调用前 ABSTAIN | Total budget 700; primary failure spends 160, leaving 540; fallback needs 1200 reserved | MR1 blocks the capable model before its call; P1, Runtime and all Tools remain unstarted |

Engineering contract:

- Routing chooses from a finite, registered candidate list. A model name emitted
  by another model cannot silently become a provider endpoint.
- Worst-case tokens are reserved before each call. Settlement happens even when
  the provider fails after accepting the prompt, so failure is not treated as free.
- Fallback is bounded to one declared transition. There is no recursive “try a
  bigger model forever” behavior.
- The same model is not retried for the injected provider timeout. Router moves
  to the next declared candidate; Tool retry and plan replanning remain separate policies.
- Budget rejection occurs before the second model request and yields explicit
  `ABSTAIN`, never an unbudgeted call.
- A successful routed response still passes the previous P1 schema, Tool
  allowlist, DAG, paper-only and executable-template checks.

Source file: `rate_model_routing.py`. The adapters remain scripted and explicitly
non-LLM so CI and the lesson are repeatable without credentials or network access.

### Previous lesson: model proposal vs Runtime authority

**M1** is a Model Gateway, not an executor. It returns untrusted text. **P1**
parses and validates that text before Runtime can resolve or call any Tool. The
default adapter is `scripted-teaching-model-v1`, which is deliberately
deterministic and marked `is_real_llm=false`; no API key or external model call
is hidden inside the demo.

| Scenario | Model output | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 模型格式错误 · 修复后执行 (default) | First response is truncated JSON; second response is valid | PARSE FAILED → one `REPAIR 1/1` → five authority checks → PLAN ACCEPTED → Runtime starts |
| 模型计划合法 · Runtime 放行 | Valid JSON matching the approved rate DAG | Raw output remains a proposal until schema, allowlist, DAG, paper-only and template checks pass |
| 模型越权 · ABSTAIN | Valid JSON adds `place_real_order` and claims automatic execution | P1 rejects the unknown capability and unsafe claims; Runtime and every Tool remain unstarted |

Engineering contract:

- JSON parsing is not authorization. A syntactically valid model response can
  still be unsafe.
- The model sees an explicit allowlist and proposal-only authority, but Runtime
  independently enforces both; prompt instructions are not a security boundary.
- P1 checks exact fields, unique task IDs, known dependencies, acyclicity,
  registered Tool names, paper-only claims and the executable strategy template.
- Format repair is bounded to one extra model response and cannot add Tool
  permissions. There is no open-ended “keep asking until it works” loop.
- Raw model text and the parsed proposal remain in Trace for audit. Neither can
  directly call a Python function, mutate state, or create an order.
- The safe demo shows the architectural seam for a future real model adapter.
  The current MR1 lesson now adds provider routing, token budgets and bounded fallback.

Source file: `rate_model_planner.py`. The rate strategy and all Tool side-effect
boundaries are unchanged.

### Previous lesson: bounded replanning and loop detection

**V1** is an Observation Gate. It separates “the Tool returned successfully”
from “the returned artifact is safe and sufficient for downstream use.” When
V1 rejects D1, Runtime removes the observation from active state, preserves it
in the audit trace, and sends structured feedback to P1.

| Scenario | Planner behavior | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 重规划 · 修订后成功 (default) | First result has only 40 rows; P1 expands the start date once | D1 complete → V1 reject → D1 invalidated → P1 revision → D1 rerun → V1 pass |
| 循环检测 · 重复计划停止 | P1 proposes the same D1 arguments again | Canonical plan fingerprint matches; no second Tool call; ABSTAIN |
| 预算耗尽 · ABSTAIN | One novel revision is allowed but its result is still insufficient | Second V1 rejection cannot create another plan; downstream remains blocked |

Engineering contract:

- Retry repeats the same Tool call after a transient execution failure.
  Replanning creates a different plan only after a successful Tool result fails
  an Observation-quality gate.
- The initial plan is fingerprinted but does not consume the revision budget.
  Only novel revised plans spend the budget.
- Fingerprints use canonical JSON, so key ordering cannot disguise a repeated
  plan. Duplicate detection runs before the budget check.
- An invalidated Observation remains visible for audit, but is removed from
  active Runtime state and can never reach A2/A10.
- Exhausting the budget or repeating a rejected plan produces an explicit
  `ABSTAIN`, not a fabricated result and not an infinite loop.
- The teaching Planner is deterministic and does not use an LLM. In a model-led
  Agent, the model may propose revisions, but Runtime must still enforce these
  fingerprints, budgets and downstream boundaries.

Source file: `rate_replanning.py`. The three teaching modes use disclosed
snapshot injection and never create real orders or external writes.

### Previous lessons: Circuit Breaker and bounded admission

The two new Runtime guards are visible as real graph nodes. **C1** protects an
external Tool from repeated calls while its dependency is unhealthy. **Q1**
controls how quickly work may enter Tools and keeps waiting work bounded.

| Scenario | Policy | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 熔断 · 冷却后恢复 | Open after 2 consecutive D1 failures; 300ms cooldown | CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN; one probe succeeds; CLOSED; workflow continues |
| 熔断 · 阻止第三次调用 | Open after 2 failures; long cooldown | Third request is rejected before `tool_execution_started`; D1 and downstream fail closed |
| 背压 · 排队后放行 | 1 active Tool, queue capacity 1, 500ms admission interval | A2 gets a permit; A10 is QUEUED; after capacity and interval allow it, A10 is DEQUEUED and called |
| 过载 · 队满立即拒绝 | 1 active Tool, queue capacity 0 | A10 is rejected before any Tool call; Join and downstream remain blocked |

Engineering contract:

- Tool argument validation occurs before the circuit counts an execution
  failure. Two retryable upstream failures open C1. An OPEN rejection does not
  call the Tool and is not counted as another upstream failure.
- Cooldown does not prove recovery. OPEN becomes HALF-OPEN and permits one
  probe. Only a successful probe closes the circuit and resets its failure
  count; a failed probe reopens it.
- Q1 separates arrival from admission. A queued task has no Tool call or Tool
  result yet. FIFO promotion happens only after capacity is released and the
  minimum admission interval passes.
- The waiting room is finite. Full queues reject work immediately instead of
  consuming unbounded memory. Rejected work is never fabricated as a branch
  result, so the all-success Join remains blocked.
- Circuit and admission state are Runtime policy, not strategy logic. Teaching
  failures, cooldowns and queue sizes are disclosed in stream events. No broker
  or external write is added.
- For deterministic teaching, C1 and Q1 are scoped to one Run. A production
  deployment must share admission/circuit state per upstream dependency across
  concurrent Runs (and coordinate it across processes); this demo makes no
  claim of service-wide protection.

Source file: `rate_resilience.py`. The Runtime in `rate_parallel.py` remains the
single owner that orders guard, Tool, Observation and terminal stream events.

### Previous lesson: time budget and cooperative cancellation

The one new concept is a **run-level stop boundary**. A deadline and a user's
Stop click signal the same `RunControl`. A stop request is not a confirmation
that a Tool has stopped; it is not a thread kill and does not undo earlier work.

| Scenario | Budget / behavior | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 演示 · 1 秒预算 (default) | 1s budget; cooperative A2 would wait 2s | Deadline → stop request → A2 exits → run timed out; completed A10 stays complete |
| 演示 · 手动停止 | 30s budget; both branches wait up to 8s | Click Stop; keep the stream connected until both Tools acknowledge exit |
| 演示 · 晚到结果 | 1s budget; A2 deliberately ignores the stop signal for 2.4s | Remain in “停止中”; late output is shown as DISCARDED, never sent to Join |

The graph topology is unchanged. Amber dashed nodes mean **stop requested**,
not **already stopped**. The stream retains the budget, reason, request,
per-Tool acknowledgment, discarded output and final stop confirmation.
Connection loss without confirmation yields **状态未知**, not “已取消”.

Engineering contract:

- The budget uses a monotonic clock and covers the whole run, including D1.
  It limits acceptance of results and scheduling of later work; it is **not a
  hard upper bound on how long a blocking Tool takes to return**.
- All Tool calls run in bounded worker pools; the owner polls controls and
  writes the ordered stream. Cooperative waits, retries, series preparation
  and source-switch boundaries check the same run scope.
- A blocking network read retains its transport timeout and may not stop
  immediately. There is no claim that Python threads are forcibly terminated.
- `POST /api/rates/cancel` with `{ "run_id": "..." }` returns 202 for a stop
  request, 409 for a known terminal run and 404 for an unknown/expired run.
  Repeated requests do not create additional effects. Old run IDs cannot stop
  a new run. Controls are process-local with bounded terminal history.
- Success and cancellation are ordered at a locked terminal boundary. Late
  output stays audit-only; completed work is not rolled back. Serial legacy
  APIs and their checkpoint/idempotency contracts are unchanged.
- Keep the stream open after pressing Stop. `run_stopped` and the final error
  frame confirm termination only after submitted callables have exited.

Source files: `rate_control.py` holds the scope and registry; `rate_parallel.py`
owns execution and result acceptance. No broker or external writes are added.

### Previous lesson: concurrency and the all-success Join

Only one new concept is introduced: independent tasks may run together, but a
dependent task must wait for **all required successful results**. Runtime uses at
most two worker threads per run. Workers send events through a queue; one owner
assigns event sequence numbers, updates run state and writes the HTTP stream.
This is concurrent scheduling, not a claim of CPU speedup under the Python GIL.

The previous lesson's four choices remain available:

| Scenario | Data / timing | Observe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 演示 · 2Y 较慢 | Official bundled snapshot; A2 waits 2s, A10 waits 0.4s | Both run; A10 completes; Join waits 1/2 for A2 |
| 演示 · 10Y 较慢 | Same snapshot; reverse the delays | Completion order reverses; Join still waits for both |
| 演示 · 10Y 失败 | Same snapshot; explicit A10 fault after 0.4s | A2 finishes; J1/S1/E1 never execute |
| 公开数据 · 无注入 | Original FRED → Treasury → disclosed snapshot fallback | No injected delay or failure; fast branches may finish too quickly to see overlap |

The delays and injected failures are recorded as `demo_*` events. Tools really
execute; the UI never replays an animation as a live run. On branch failure we
drain the already-running read-only sibling, then return a failure with its
completed results still in the trace. We do not claim to cancel a running Tool.

Core check: **“One branch finished” is not the same as “Join may proceed.”**
Try both speed orders, then the failure scenario, without changing the strategy.

Visualization is a required design consideration for every new Agent lesson:
show real state transitions and inspectable inputs/outputs, keep the default
view focused, and never animate a simulated process as live execution.

Current UI:

```text
web/rate_console.html        focused default page
web/rate_console.css         responsive Graph / Stream layout
web/rate_console_core.js     pure event and protocol reducer
web/rate_console.js          incremental DOM updates and stream reader
web/index.html               retained historical Workbench shell
web/rate_workbench.js        retained historical rate overlay
```

To revisit the advanced event-market experiment, run `python3 serve_r12.py`.

Console checks: `node --test test_rate_console.cjs` and
`python3 -m unittest test_rate_http test_rate_agent test_rate_parallel test_rate_control test_rate_ui_contract`.
For the optional real-browser smoke test, install Playwright in your test
environment and run `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/chromium node test_rate_console_browser.cjs`.
That test starts a temporary local HTTP server with explicitly labelled fixture
data; it tests rendering and streaming, not public-source availability.
